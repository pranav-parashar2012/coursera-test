    <p>Usually, an appetizer is a small serving of food — just a few bites — meant to be eaten before an entree, and often shared by several people. You can also call an appetizer an hors d'oeuvre. An appetizer is meant to stimulate your appetite, making you extra hungry for your meal. This is where the word comes from, literally meaning "something to whet the appetite" or "something to appetize."

      <div Class ="title2"> Main Course </div>
    <p>The main course is food that is served as the main dish in a multi-course meal. It is often served after the entrée. In the United States, the main course may be called the "entrée".

    The main course is usually the biggest dish on a menu. The main ingredient is often meat or fish. It most often follows an appetizer, soup, or salad, and is often followed by a dessert.

      <div Class ="title3"> Dessert </div>
    <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur; however, in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.
